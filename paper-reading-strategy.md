# Paper Reading Strategy

## Core principle

> "The faintest ink is more powerful than the strongest memory."

All paper reading should leave durable notes in a central system (index cards, digital notes, or both).

## Workflow

1. **Survey**
   - Title, keywords, abstract, conclusion.
   - Stop here if the paper is not aligned.

2. **Read**
   - Tables and figures.
   - Introduction.
   - Results.
   - Experiments.
   - Discussion.

3. **Note taking**
   - Capture notes in a separate space (not on the PDF).
   - Summarise key ideas, methods, and questions.
   - Tag notes by topic, methodology, and relevance to my Master's research project.
