# Choosing a Research Project – Principles

## Priorities

- Prioritise mentorship and marketable skills.
- Keep the project small and tightly scoped.
- Define data sources and check availability early.

## Guiding questions

- What are my broad interests? (e.g., habits, communication, “supercommunicators”.)
- Is there an unresolved gap in current literature?
- Is this a question that needs answering?
- Can it be completed within my Master's timeframe?

## Next steps

- Start logging candidate topic ideas.
- For each candidate, note data sources, methods, and fit with programme outcomes.
